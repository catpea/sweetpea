Signal and Web Component Enhanced Web Apps

## NOTES

- vplSystem bindInputs duplicates functionality of bind element, i don't want to inject bind element everywhere, this should also be updated to work with all inputs.

## TODO
- port id="out2" icon="lightning" not all state must sit in signal tree some state can be inside element as it relates purely to UI
- pipe component
- generalize signal tree funcions SIGNAL.ensignal/SIGNAL.designal
- dumpt tree to json
- pan
- zoom
- minimap
- generalize data-binding into a shared function so that bind and auto-bind use the same code
