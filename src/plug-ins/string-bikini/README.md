## string-bikini - in a world full of strings, be a class, stand out as an instance, and shine like a property!

Welcome to the String Bikini 3000! 🎉 The ONLY string processor in the universe that transforms ordinary strings into extraordinary classes, mystical instances, and prosperous properties! 🌟

```JavaScript
// Import our fun utility
import { toClass, toInstance, toProperty } from 'string-bikini';

// Classify your strings!
const MyClass = toClass('fluffyUnicorn');
const unicornInstance = toInstance('FluffyUnicorn');
const speedProperty = toProperty('IncredibleSpeed');

console.log(`Behold, ${MyClass}, the one and only!`);
console.log(`Say hello to your new robot friend: `, unicornInstance);
console.log(`Check out the blazing speed: `, speedProperty);

```

### toClass

Transform your plain ol' strings into first-class classes that even your grandparents would be proud of! 🏫

Example: "furryBear" becomes class FurryBear, a legend in the making!

### toInstance

Bring life to the classroom by turning words into living instances. Let your strings dance into existence. 👯‍♀️

Example: "AwesomeRobot" transforms into awesomeRobot, ready to take over mundane tasks and your coffee breaks!

### toProperty

What are class and instance without some juicy properties? Turn strings into properties that make your code the talk of the town. 🌆

Example: "IncredibleSpeed" becomes everyone's favorite incredibleSpeed, and yes, it's faster than your Wi-Fi!
