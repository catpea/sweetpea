# Hello, I have a question about txtvers in context of mdns advertisement, is that a special field and what other txt information is usually sent.

In the context of mDNS (Multicast DNS) advertisement, a **TXT record** is a special type of DNS record used to store arbitrary text-based information. It is part of the DNS service discovery mechanism, typically used for adding additional metadata or configuration details to service advertisements.

### What is a TXT record in mDNS?
A **TXT record** is essentially a way for a device or service to include additional information when advertising its presence over mDNS. When a device or service broadcasts an mDNS advertisement (for example, when it registers its service), it can include a TXT record as part of the service information. This allows the service to convey various metadata or configuration settings to other devices on the network.

The TXT record is typically used to convey:
- **Service-specific parameters**: Information needed by clients to correctly interact with the service.
- **Configuration settings**: Such as user preferences or authentication keys, depending on the service.
- **Status or version information**: To indicate which version of the service is being provided, or to communicate other status-related details.

### Structure of mDNS TXT records
- The TXT record is made up of **key-value pairs**, where each key is a string, and each value is a string or a piece of data that is associated with that key.
- The key-value pairs are typically encoded as strings like `"key=value"`. Multiple key-value pairs can be sent within a single TXT record.

### Common Types of Information in mDNS TXT records
Here are some examples of the types of information that might be included in TXT records during mDNS advertisements:

1. **Service Information**:
   - `"version=1.0"`: The version of the service.
   - `"path=/service-path"`: The path or endpoint where the service is available.
   - `"protocol=https"`: The protocol used by the service (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, CoAP).
   - `"interface=ethernet"`: Specifies the network interface type.

2. **Configuration Data**:
   - `"port=8080"`: The port on which the service is available.
   - `"hostname=example.local"`: The hostname of the device providing the service.
   - `"serialNumber=12345"`: A unique identifier for the device.

3. **Authentication or Access Control**:
   - `"username=user1"`: Username required for service access.
   - `"auth=token123"`: A token or authentication string.

4. **Status Information**:
   - `"status=active"`: Indicates whether the service is active or not.
   - `"status=offline"`: Marks the service as unavailable.
   - `"location=room1"`: The physical location of the service or device.

5. **Metadata about the Device**:
   - `"deviceType=printer"`: The type of device offering the service.
   - `"os=linux"`: The operating system the service is running on.
   - `"model=ABC123"`: The model identifier for the device.

### Examples of mDNS TXT records in use:
- For a printer service, you might see:
  ```
  _ipp._tcp.local.    IN    PTR    printer._ipp._tcp.local.
  printer._ipp._tcp.local.  IN    TXT    "version=1.0" "model=LaserJet 100" "location=office"
  ```

- For a web server, it might advertise:
  ```
  _http._tcp.local.    IN    PTR    webserver._http._tcp.local.
  webserver._http._tcp.local.  IN    TXT    "version=2.1" "port=80" "status=active"
  ```

### Special Considerations:
- **Limitations on Size**: mDNS has some limitations on the size of individual records. A TXT record is typically limited to 255 characters per field, and the total record size should be kept within reasonable limits to avoid fragmentation in the network.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The TXT records can be updated dynamically as the service changes its configuration or status.

### Conclusion:
The **TXT record** in mDNS is not a special field in the sense of being proprietary but is a fundamental part of how services advertise themselves in the mDNS system. It allows the service to share additional information (such as version, port, location, status, etc.) with clients and other devices on the network.

# and what is the structure of the fullname filed in mdns? I am getting "myhost._http._tcp.local"


The **full name** (also called **fully qualified domain name** or FQDN) in **mDNS** (Multicast DNS) follows a specific structure designed for service discovery. In your example, **"myhost._http._tcp.local"**, we can break it down into components to understand its structure.

### Structure of the mDNS Full Name
The full name is composed of several parts, each serving a specific purpose in the context of mDNS service discovery:

1. **Service Instance Name** (`myhost` in your example):
   - This part represents the **name of the specific instance** of the service being advertised. It could be the name of the device, machine, or specific service instance (like a printer, web server, etc.).
   - In your case, "myhost" is the instance name of the service. It could represent a specific device or application instance in your network.

2. **Service Type** (`_http` in your example):
   - This part specifies the **type of service** being advertised. In mDNS, service types are often prefixed with an underscore (`_`).
   - In your case, **`_http`** refers to an HTTP service (likely a web server).
   - Other examples include:
     - **`_ftp`** for FTP services,
     - **`_ipp`** for Internet Printing Protocol (IPPs),
     - **`_ssh`** for SSH services.

3. **Protocol** (`_tcp` in your example):
   - This part indicates the **protocol** used by the service, typically either TCP or UDP. It's also prefixed by an underscore (`_`).
   - In your case, **`_tcp`** means the service uses the TCP protocol.
   - If the service uses UDP, it would be **`_udp`**.

4. **Domain** (`local` in your example):
   - This part represents the **domain** where the service is advertised. In mDNS, the domain is almost always set to **`.local`**, which indicates that the service is being advertised locally within a local area network (LAN).
   - In contrast to regular DNS, which relies on globally distributed servers, mDNS uses **`.local`** to indicate services are only available on the local network without needing an internet connection.

### Putting It All Together:
For the example **"myhost._http._tcp.local"**:
- **`myhost`** is the **service instance name** (i.e., the device or service's name).
- **`_http`** is the **service type** (indicating itâ€™s a web service).
- **`_tcp`** is the **protocol** used for the service (in this case, TCP).
- **`local`** is the **domain** (indicating the service is advertised on the local network).

### General mDNS Name Format:
The general format of an mDNS service advertisement name is:
```
<instance-name>.<service-type>.<protocol>.<domain>
```
Where:
- `<instance-name>`: The unique name of the service instance.
- `<service-type>`: The type of service being offered (e.g., `_http`, `_ftp`, `_printer`).
- `<protocol>`: The communication protocol used (either `_tcp` or `_udp`).
- `<domain>`: Typically `.local`, which indicates the service is local to the network.

### Examples:
- **"printer._ipp._tcp.local"**: A printer service (instance name: "printer"), offering the Internet Printing Protocol (_ipp) over TCP, in the local network.
- **"mydevice._ssh._tcp.local"**: A device named "mydevice," offering an SSH service (_ssh) over TCP, in the local network.
- **"room-light._mqtt._tcp.local"**: A service named "room-light," using the MQTT protocol (_mqtt) over TCP, in the local network.

### Summary:
The structure of an mDNS name helps distinguish between different services on the local network by combining the service's instance name, service type, protocol, and domain. The most common use case is to advertise services like printers, file servers, or web servers within a local network (usually under the `.local` domain).
